# FigPro-UI-UX-Editior


<h2>INTRODUCTION</h2>


The demand for efficient and collaborative UI/UX design tools has surged with the increasing complexity of digital products. FigPro addresses this need by integrating design, prototyping, and feedback collection into a single platform. Traditional design tools often fall short in providing seamless real-time collaboration and communication features, leading to inefficiencies and delays in the design process. Designers frequently struggle with fragmented workflows, where feedback, iteration, and development are disjointed, resulting in miscommunication and prolonged project timelines.  The primary objective of this project is to develop a robust UI/UX editor that facilitates real-time collaboration, enhances communication, and streamlines the design process. FigPro's feature set includes multi-user cursors, cursor chat, reactions, comment bubbles, diverse shape creation tools, image uploading, freeform drawing, customization options, keyboard actions, undo/redo functionality, and comprehensive project history tracking.
